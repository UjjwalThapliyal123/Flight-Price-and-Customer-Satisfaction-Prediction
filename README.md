# Flight-Price-and-Customer-Satisfaction-Prediction

This project focuses on predicting Flight Prices and Customer Satisfaction using advanced machine learning models.

For flight price prediction, we employ regression techniques such as:

Linear Regression
Random Forest Regressor
XGBoost Regressor
For customer satisfaction classification, we use classification models including:

Logistic Regression
Random Forest Classifier
Gradient Boosting Classifier
The project aims to provide accurate predictions by leveraging feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation techniques to enhance performance.
